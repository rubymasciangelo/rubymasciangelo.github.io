                        <p>I moved to Seattle from Hawaii and I'm currently living near Green Lake.
                            I always wanted to have a career in the arts and what really drew me to
                            programming is that it's such a creative industry. I love solving problems 
                            and figuring out better ways to do things. I'm extremely detail oriented and also able to conceptualize how all the pieces 
                            contribute to the big picture.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am almost done studying software development at the Tech Academy. So far 
				I have worked on projects implementing and integrating C#, HTML, CSS, 
				JavaScript, .Net framework, bootstrap and databases in SQL. Building 
				and working with databases in SQL was my favorite part of the bootcamp. 
				I also enjoyed C# and would like to learn a lot more about it going forward, 
				especially how it could be used to write programs for augmented reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next few weeks I will be 
                             working on a live project with other students. I feel that I have 
                             gained a well-rounded understanding of programming from this bootcamp
                             and I'm very excited to start working on real projects!
