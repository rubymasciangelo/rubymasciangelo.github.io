                        <p>I moved to Seattle from Hawaii and I'm currently living near Green Lake.
                            I always wanted to have a career in the arts and what really drew me to
                            programming is that it's such a creative industry. I love solving problems 
                            and figuring out better ways to do things. I'm extremely detail oriented
                            and also able to conceptualize how everything could contribute to the
                            bigger picture.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have completed an intensive software development course at the Tech Academy. 
                            I worked on projects implementing and integrating C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                            .Net framework, bootstrap and databases in SQL. The single most important
                            thing that I learned was how to teach myself unfamiliar concepts and utilize 
                            in problem solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>I participated in an internship for Prosper IT and created a code first MVC
                            with functioning data integration. I was responsible for starting this project
                            and developing the database connectivity. I also created an accessible and pleasant
                            user interface and populated the database with seed users to run on startup.
                        </p>
